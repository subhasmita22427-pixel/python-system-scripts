# Python System Scripts

This repository contains Python utility scripts built to strengthen core programming fundamentals and demonstrate how Python is used in real-world automation tasks.

## Current Projects

### 1. Password Strength Checker
A command-line utility that evaluates password strength based on:
- Length constraints
- Presence of letters, digits, and special characters
- Rejection of spaces and weak-only inputs

The script clearly explains why a password is weak and guides users on how to improve it.

### 2. Smart Log File Analyzer
A utility that processes log files and generates a concise report by counting:
- ERROR messages
- WARNING messages
- INFO messages

This helps in understanding system behavior and identifying potential issues quickly.

### 3. Search and Sort Utility
A menu-driven program that performs common data operations such as:
- Searching for elements in a list
- Sorting numbers in ascending and descending order
- Separating even and odd numbers
- Finding multiples of a user-defined number

Focuses on implementing logic without relying on shortcuts.

## Purpose
This repository is developed incrementally as new utilities are added.
Each script emphasizes clean code, proper input validation, and practical use cases.

## Tech Used
- Python 3
- File handling
- Data validation and processing
- Command-line interaction
